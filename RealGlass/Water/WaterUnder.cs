    /// <remarks>
    /// - Only camera mods take the camera under: the game's own keeps it 2 m over the water
    ///   (CameraController.CalculateCameraHeightOffset). ACME and First Person Camera move the game's
    ///   camera (both reference CameraController and its camera), which <see cref="GameCamera"/> finds.
    /// - The water's level at the camera: TerrainManager.SampleRawHeightSmoothWithWater, the game
    ///   camera's own call (the simulation's two frames blended as the water is drawn), against the
    ///   terrain alone (SampleRawHeightSmooth): no water there, or the camera under the ground, is no
    ///   view from under the water.
    /// - Per pixel the shader decides: under where the near plane's point is below the level, so a
    ///   camera half in the water gets the waterline across the frame.
    /// - Before the image effects: after the fog, the glass and the transparents; bloom and the tone
    ///   mapping come after, as for everything else.
    /// - THE DEPTH (2026-10-30): its own copy of the camera's depth texture, taken by a second buffer at
    ///   AfterFinalPass -- before the forward water and every image effect, where the city reflection's
    ///   copy is taken (WaterSurfaceMask) -- and held as a temporary texture to the pass. Until then it read
    ///   the global _CameraDepthTexture before the image effects, and in the author's game that read far
    ///   too near: every pixel took the frame as drawn, the city above sharp through the surface, no haze.
    /// - The game draws no water seen from below (Cull Back), nor the mod's layers on it (WaterSky,
    ///   WaterFoam: Cull Back): the surface from below is this pass's alone. The city reflection adds
    ///   nothing meanwhile (WaterController).
    /// - THE SURFACE FROM BELOW (2026-10-30, the author's call: the view looking up fell short; the
    ///   shader's header has the model): the world above through Snell's window reads the frame where it is on
    ///   screen and the sky on the water's live cube where it is not, and the ripples are as rough as the
    ///   sky layer averages them from above (<see cref="WaterSkyLayer.ShareRipples"/>); the sun through
    ///   the waves takes its light from the game's.
    /// - THE SHAFTS read the game's own shadow map of the sun (CameraController.LateUpdate gives its
    ///   main light the shadows of the graphics options): right after the light renders it, the map is
    ///   bound for the frame and its cascades' constants are written into a 24 x 1 texture (the
    ///   shader's pass 1), as Unity sets them for the light's own shadows -- probed in the Unity 5.6
    ///   editor (Direct3D 11, OpenGL Core; legacy deferred, four cascades): the shadowed and the sunlit
    ///   point told apart from a later camera pass, the frame byte for byte the same with the capture.
