// The city in the map's water, by day and by night (RealGlass/Water/WaterCityReflection.cs has the
// model and its sources; ported from RealLight's CityReflection, 2026-10-03, which checked it against
// the CPU in an editor test). Drawn from a command buffer after the opaque image effects, before
// Bloom, so reflected lights glow as the lights do. Only on visible simulated water: the separate
// surface-depth pass records the water meshes, independently of the terrain behind them. Four passes:
//   0 TRACE (a cube round the camera, into a half-size buffer with mips): the ray reflected by the
//     ripples at the water's point (RippleSlope: the game's own ripple texture, or ours, read as
//     the game reads it; the flat sea's mirror ray with the gain at 0), its
//     slope divided by the Length slider (the reflection drawn longer), followed through the depth
//     texture; where it meets the city, the city's colour (a half-size copy of the frame) in place
//     of the sky the water's cube already shows, x the rough sea's reflectance at the view's angle.
//     rgb = that x a, a = 1 on the water (0 elsewhere).
//   1 STREAKS (a Blit): a Gaussian up and down, the waves too short for the screen. Read from the
//     mip whose texels are half a sigma, 17 taps over +-3 sigma. Weighted by a: only water is
//     averaged (normalised convolution), so the shore does not darken the reflection's edge.
//   2 COMPOSITE (the cube, onto the frame): on the water, the streaked rgb / a. Added (Blend One
//     One); never taking a pixel below black.
//   3 HISTORY: reprojected from the actual water surface, clamped to the current neighbourhood.
