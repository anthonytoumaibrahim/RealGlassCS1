// Foam on the map's water (RealGlass/Water/WaterFoam.cs has the model and its sources). Drawn on the
// game's own water meshes, right after each of the game's water draws, with the game's property
// block (WaterGame.cginc): the vertices land where the game's water is, and every input is the
// game's simulation as the game's own shader reads it. The game's water is drawn untouched first;
// this only adds foam, nothing anywhere else.
//
// IN LAYERS (2026-10-24, the author: "In real life, the foam is often layered"), as foam ages
// (Monahan & Lu 1990's stages of a whitecap; FoamOptics' numbers):
//   FRESH    stage A, made by a crest breaking now: dense, the brightest (Koepke 1984), patch-heavy
//            sheets with small burst-bubble holes, lit as if it had volume (a normal from its
//            thickness: Crest's "foam 3D lighting"); gone in about a second.
//   RESIDUAL stage B, the sheet left behind: lace-heavy (its holes grow), thinner (the water shows
//            through), dimmer, its lace torn into streaks (domain warping); tens of seconds (Potter
//            et al. 2015), so the foam of the last few waves lies one over the other.
//   BUBBLES  under both, the bubbles the break pushed down: the water's own colour made paler (the
//            body reflectance f b_b / (a + b_b) with the bubbles' backscatter added: Gordon et al.
//            1975, Morel & Prieur 1977), seen a little under the surface (a parallax offset along the
//            refracted eye ray: Crest's "foam bubbles") through the water above them (pure water's
//            absorption, Pope & Fry 1997), under the sky's reflection (x 1 - Fresnel).
// THE AMOUNT (the Amount row) is the share of the model's foam, as it always was; each layer keeps
// its own life. A breaking crest and the swash stay solid white from a third of it up.
//
// HOW MUCH FOAM, and HOW OLD, from three sources, combined as independent chances:
//   SHORE    the surf, a band of the sea along the waterline measured in DISTANCE from it (War
//            Thunder phases its shore waves by the distance to the shore): the distance is the depth
//            over the seabed's slope under the point (the game's coasts drop steeply -- in the
//            author's city under 6% of the shore's water is shallower than 2 m -- so a band of depth
//            alone was a single thin line, 2026-10-24). Broken waves (bores) every few seconds, the
//            bigger breaking farther out (McCowan 1894: as deep as their height allows), running in at
//            the shallow-water speed sqrt(g d) of a gently shelving beach -- slowing and bunching
//            toward the waterline -- in sets of strong and weak ones (wave groups). A point's age is
//            the time since the last bore passed it: a bright crest line, the residual sheet and the
//            bubbles fading behind it, the last bores' foam under the next. The swash at the very
//            edge stays white. Farther out the same crests are the swell coming in, breaking here and
//            there before they reach the surf (spilling): short streaks of white, fewer the farther
//            out (the author's picture of such streaks, 2026-10-24). At the sea's level only.
//   FAST     where the flow is fast (rapids, weirs, dam outflows), more where the surface is steep;
//            the core fresh, the fringe old.
//   FRONTS   where the water is rising fast on a steep face: the front of a tsunami, a flood or a dam
//            break, fresh (Chentanez & Mueller 2010's breaking test: fast and steep -- the game's calm
//            sea rises and falls up to a metre a water frame everywhere, but gently); and on its back,
//            where the water falls again behind the crest, the residual sheet and the bubbles.
// WHERE it is white: the foam pattern (FoamPattern.cs), thresholded at the level that leaves that
// share above it; carried along the flow in two phases half a cycle apart and crossfaded (Vlachos
// 2010, the game's own way with its ripples).
// FILTERED so it does not sparkle: where a pixel spans more than the pattern's features, the
// threshold turns into a ramp as wide as the variation averaged away, and far away the pixel shows
// exactly the share it should (the amount itself).
