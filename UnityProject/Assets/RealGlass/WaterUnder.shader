// The view from under the water (RealGlass/Water/WaterUnder.cs draws it, Water/WaterUnderOptics.cs has
// the numbers and their sources; 2026-10-24, its look redone 2026-10-28 after a player's picture): one
// full-screen pass while the camera is at or below the water's level, on a copy of the frame before the
// image effects. Per pixel, the ray from the near plane on -- under water where that point is below the
// level, so a camera half in the water gets the waterline across the frame -- through the water to what
// it ends on:
//   THE MURK  the image formation of Jaffe 1990 / McGlamery 1975 as revised by Akkaynak & Treibitz
//             (2018, "A Revised Underwater Image Formation Model"): what the ray ends on x e^(-c d) +
//             the veiling light. The water's beam attenuation c per channel (WaterUnderOptics: pure
//             water, dissolved matter, particles), so what lies under the water keeps its shape and
//             takes the water's teal as it recedes. The veiling light is in-scattered daylight, which
//             fades with depth as e^(-K_d z) (K_d after Kirk 1984): integrated along the ray as its
//             depth changes, B0 e^(-K z0) c (1 - e^(-(c - K dy) d)) / (c - K dy) -- the water darker
//             looking down, lighter looking up; brighter toward the sun, as water's scattering is peaked
//             forward (Henyey & Greenstein 1941). B0: the water's own reflectance from those numbers x
//             the daylight x the n-squared law (WaterUnderOptics.Vectors).
//   THE SHAFTS  the sun's share of that veiling light comes only from water the sunbeams reach: the
//             ray sampled in steps (each start jittered per pixel, Jimenez 2014's interleaved gradient
//             noise), each sample's sunbeam traced back up, refracted, to where it entered the surface,
//             and that point tested against the game's own shadow map of the sun (grabbed at the
//             light's AfterShadowMap with its cascades: WaterUnder.cs) -- the light between the shadows
//             of bridges and buildings hangs in the water as shafts (single scattering with volumetric
//             shadows, Toth & Umenhoffer 2009). The share kept is the samples' lit share, weighted as
//             each adds to the veil.
//   THE BED   the game lights the seabed as dry land: x e^(-K_d depth), the daylight that reaches it;
//             the sun's share of it focused by the ripples into caustics -- the area a beam of sunlight
//             through the surface lands on (Watt 1990's beam tracing): 1 / det(I + D (1 - 1/n) H), H the
//             ripple surface's curvature, D the depth (Hessian by central differences of the ripple
//             texture the water uses).
//   THE SURFACE FROM BELOW (redone 2026-10-30 on the author's call: the view looking up fell short) a
//             level plane at the water's height, each ripple a facet: the ripple texture filtered over
//             the pixel's footprint, the slopes that filtering averages away kept as roughness, as the
//             sky layer reckons them from above (LEAN mapping, Olano & Baker 2010) -- the waves show near
//             and smooth out far off. Facets met at less than the critical angle (Snell's window, 48.6 deg
//             of straight up) let the world above through along the refracted ray (the whole sky squeezed
//             into the window, the horizon at its rim; the frame where that ray lands on the screen -- the
//             game culls the water's underside -- the sky on the water's live cube where it does not), x
//             the exact Fresnel transmission x n^2 (the radiance's gain into the denser water: Mobley
//             1994's n-squared law). The averaged-away slopes make the window's rim a band, not a line:
//             the share of facets inside it is Gaussian across it, and beyond it the facets tilted toward
//             the eye still let the sky through -- what makes a choppy surface's underside read as waves.
//             The rest is total internal reflection: the water below along the mirror ray, darker the
//             steeper down (VeilBelow). The sun through the waves: Walter, Marschner, Li & Torrance 2007's
//             microfacet transmission on the same slopes, where the shadow map lets its light reach the
//             surface.
