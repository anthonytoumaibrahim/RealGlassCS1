// The sky in the map's water, as real water reflects it (RealGlass/Water/WaterSkyLayer.cs has the
// model and its sources; the author, 2026-10-08, after a Battlefield 6 screenshot of Lake Mead:
// "that's EXACTLY how we want ours to look"). Drawn on the game's own water meshes right after each of
// the game's water draws, with the game's per-patch property block (WaterGame.cginc), as the foam is;
// meanwhile the game's own water reflects no sky (its cube is black while this layer draws:
// WaterSurface).
//
// WHY A LAYER: the game reads its sky cube along each ripple's reflected ray and adds it with no
// Fresnel of its own, so a cube can only carry a reflectance by that ray's height -- which counts each
// ripple's tilt twice (for a view 35 deg down and a facet tilted a toward the eye, the true incidence is
// 55 - a deg, the cube's 55 - 2a): rippled water came out about twice too bright, with the horizon's
// sky in it. Here every pixel knows the eye and its ripple:
//   NORMAL    the game's own (RGGameWaterNormal: its ripples carried along the flow, + the surface's slope).
//   HOW MUCH  Schlick's Fresnel for water on that facet; where the ripple texture's mips have averaged
//             ripples away (a share u of their slopes, from the mip the GPU reads), the rough sea's
//             reflectance (Cox & Munk's slopes: _RGSeaTable) on the filtered normal instead -- what
//             filtering takes from the normals is roughness, not slope (Bruneton, Neyret & Holzschuch
//             2010, "Real-time Realistic Ocean Lighting using Seamless Transitions from Geometry to BRDF").
//   OF WHAT   the sky the player sees: a live cube of the game's skybox, Volumetric Weather's clouds in
//             it (the glass's GlassSky; _RGWaterSkyCube), read along the facet's mirror ray (a ray turned
//             below the level meets the next wave: mirrored back up), as blurred as the averaged-away
//             slopes spread it; towards a published real sky by its weight (RGSkyLight).
//   ONTO      Blend One OneMinusSrcAlpha, premultiplied: the water as the game drew it x (1 - F) + the
//             sky x F -- light that is reflected is not also let through. Queue Geometry+2, before the
//             game's fog: far water hazes as the game's own water does.
//   THE SUN'S GLITTER (2026-10-17, with the FFT waves: WaterSpectrum.cs): the sun's reflection off a
//             sea of facets whose slopes are Gaussian about the ripple texture's own (LEAN mapping,
//             Olano & Baker 2010: the mean from the filtered normal, the covariance from what the
//             mips averaged away -- WaterSpectrum.Table, by the mip the GPU reads each of the game's
//             two reads at -- plus the waves too short for the texture). The microfacet sum for a
//             distant light, E F p(slope of h) / (4 cos v cos^4 h), Smith's masking for Gaussian
//             slopes (Bruneton, Neyret & Holzschuch 2010, after Walter et al. 2007): far away the
//             averaged-away slopes widen it into the glitter path toward a low sun; close up the
//             texture's own facets catch it. Added over the water; the game's own highlight (exponent
//             512 on its normal, x the material's _SpecColor) is turned off meanwhile. SIZE (2026-10-21,
//             after the release: "the glitter area is way too big"): the slopes the glitter sees x a
//             size, its peak kept -- the sun's and the moon's each their own strength and size.
