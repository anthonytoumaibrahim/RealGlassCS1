# Checks and stages a Workshop release, so that the only thing left to do by hand is the click in
# the game's Content Manager (Volumetric Weather's script, 2026-10-20, for this mod). Every step
# checks itself and the script STOPS at the first thing that is not right; nothing it does is hard
# to undo (the one folder it takes away is moved, not deleted).
#
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\release.ps1 -DryRun   # every check, no copy, no move
#   powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\release.ps1           # the real thing
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Checks the release is ready: the game is closed, the git tree is committed, the ModsLibCS1
#      submodule is pinned and pushed, Mod.Version is newer than the last v* tag, CHANGELOG.md has
#      that version dated (not "unreleased"), no personal name in the repo's files, and the shader
#      bundles were built after the last shader edit.
#   2. Builds (which deploys to Addons\Mods) and checks the deployed DLL: it carries Mod.Version and
#      embeds the three shader bundles at their sizes on disk, both room atlases, the icon and
#      en.xml; each bundle holds every shader with real code for every API of its platform; the
#      folder holds exactly the four shipped files, the libraries and notices as in the repo.
#   3. Runs every offline test, the Metal (Mac) and AMD compile checks of the shipped shaders
#      included; one failure stops the release.
#   4. THE FIRST UPLOAD ($workshopId empty): stops there -- the game's Share button uploads
#      Addons\Mods\RealGlass as it stands, and prints the steps by hand.
#      EVERY LATER ONE: copies exactly the four shipped files into the SUBSCRIBED Workshop folder,
#      reads the version and the hashes back out of it, and moves the local Addons\Mods copy out of
#      the way, so the game loads ONE copy of the mod -- the subscribed one, whose Content Manager
#      button reads "Update". A local copy beside it is how a "Share" button (= a brand-new
#      Workshop item) appears; with the folder gone that click cannot be made.
#   5. Prints what is left to do by hand, the GitHub release included.
#
# Why the subscribed folder: a mod's published id comes from its folder name (PluginInfo), so only
# the copy in steamapps\workshop\content\255710\<id> knows it is that item.
